Cars and cars.soft are two different files and we can tell this by noting that the inode numbers for both of these files are different, the links for each file is only one, the creation dates differ since they were created at different times and the size of each file are different and this indicates that the original contains the most information and the soft link contains enough information to be able to 'point' to the original.
