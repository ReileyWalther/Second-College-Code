You can tell cars and cars.hard are two names of the same file since the inode number, when you type -i after the ls command and shown at the beginning of the line, are the same for the two different files and the link numbers are both two for each file, meaning that each file links to another. The size of the files are exactlt the same too and they were created at exactly the same time.
